1. Design Philosophy
1.1 Core Design Goals

Premium, modern, and calm

Minimal visual noise

Strong depth through soft layers

Designed for glanceability, not interaction overload

Widget-first thinking (UI must work at small sizes)

1.2 Visual Inspiration (From Reference Image)

The reference UI demonstrates:

Soft rounded containers

Layered card system

Muted color palette with high contrast text

Friendly visual language (avatars → emojis in our case)

Clear hierarchy using elevation, not borders

We translate this language into:

Calendar dots instead of avatars

Emojis instead of profile pictures

Time-based data instead of monetary data

2. Color System
2.1 Base Palette (Inspired, Not Copied)
Primary Background

Deep muted indigo / charcoal purple
Used as main canvas for app screens

Secondary Surface

Warm beige / sand tone
Used for cards, widget foregrounds

Accent

Soft gold / amber
Used for:

Today indicator

Active dot

Emoji highlight

Text

Primary: Near-white

Secondary: Muted lavender-gray

Disabled: Low-opacity gray

3. Theme Variants (Mandatory)
3.1 Light Mode

Background: Soft off-white

Cards: Warm beige

Dots: Neutral gray / muted color

Emoji: Full color

3.2 Dark Mode (OLED Optimized)

Background: Near-black / deep indigo

Cards: Dark muted purple

Dots: Soft glow

Reduced contrast strain

3.3 Glassmorphism Mode (Premium)

Semi-transparent frosted surfaces

Blur radius adjustable

Tint color inherits wallpaper hue

Subtle noise texture to avoid banding

4. Typography System
4.1 Font Style

Sans-serif, rounded geometric

High legibility at small widget sizes

4.2 Hierarchy

Title (Month / Year): Medium weight

Numeric data (dates): Bold

Labels: Regular

Secondary info: Reduced opacity

Typography must never overpower dots.

5. Layout System
5.1 Grid Rules

8dp base spacing system

Widgets snap to grid internally

Equal dot spacing horizontally and vertically

5.2 Corner Radius

Large cards: 28–32dp

Small widgets: 20–24dp

Dots: Perfect circles

5.3 Elevation

No hard shadows

Soft ambient elevation

Glass mode uses light glow instead of shadow
